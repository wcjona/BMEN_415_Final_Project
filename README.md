# BMEN_415_Final_Project
Welcome to our Repository! The models have been divided into Classification, Regression and Image Classification. Please note, the results of each model have been saved into the files. 

However, some of the models will currently not run properly due to incorrect file paths to the datasets. This is because our models were uploaded and not chagned from Google Collabratory. To fix this simply adjust the file path of the imported datasets. 

For any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to Jonathan via [email](mailto:jonathan.chong@ucalgary.ca).
